# Souna's Arch Tools
Welcome ! Here's one of the tools I use on my Arch installation, and it's obviously subject to evolution and improvement.

Oh ? Interested by using it ? Nothing special but.. Why not.

Just clone the repo by typing the following lines

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SounaVR/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

Now you need to add `dwm &` to your startup file, it's `.xinitrc` in my case (for Xorg).
Reboot and you're done!
